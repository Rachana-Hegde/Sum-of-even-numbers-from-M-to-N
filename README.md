# ➕ Sum of Even Numbers from M to N – Python Program

This is a simple Python program that calculates the **sum of all even numbers** between two user-defined integers `M` and `N` (inclusive). It’s a great practice task for using loops and conditionals.

## 📌 Description

* The user enters two integers:
  * `a` → starting number (`M`)
  * `b` → ending number (`N`)
* The program loops from `a` to `b` and adds all **even numbers** in that range.
* Finally, it prints the total sum.

### 🧾 Sample Input & Output

**Input:**

```
Enter starting number: 4  
Enter ending number: 10
```

**Output:**

```
28
```

**Explanation:**
Even numbers between 4 and 10 → `4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 28`

## 🧠 Logic

* Use a `for` loop from `a` to `b` (inclusive).
* Check if each number is even using `i % 2 == 0`.
* If it is, add it to the `result` variable.
* Print the final result.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Save the code in a file, e.g., `sum_even.py`
2. Run it using Python:
```bash
python sum_even.py
```
3. Enter the start and end values when prompted.

## 🎯 Use Case

* Perfect for practicing:
  * Looping (`for` loops)
  * Conditional logic (`if` statements)
  * Summation and arithmetic

* Can be extended to:
  * Sum of odd numbers
  * Count of even/odd numbers
  * Multiples of a given number
